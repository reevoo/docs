# Teams

- We have two team leaders in @cwninja and @rfonglip.
- Teams are decided before a planning game.
  - Team selection will be optimised for different things at different times.
- During the iteration, about 1/2 the team should have a 1-1 with their team lead.
  - Team leads will try and ensure everyone gets a 1-1 every two weeks. If you don't, prod your team leader.
  - 1-1s are in addition to the less frequent 1-1s with @jaikoo, who is
    still your line manager for more substantial things (pay, performance, etcâ€¦).
- Team leaders are responsable for making sure you're not over working.
