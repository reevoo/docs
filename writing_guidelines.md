# Guidelines to Writing Guidelines

- Guidelines should be a last resort; developers are notoriously bad at reading and forgetting things. Why not find a tool that enforces the guideline instead?
- Explain **what** the guideline is, **why** the guideline is in place and **how** to enforce the guideline (if applicable). If you can't explain why, don't recommend it.
- Keep it short - short is readable. Bullet points and referencing other articles work.
