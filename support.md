# Support

  1. We answer short questions and write cards.
  2. If it will take more than 20 minutes, we can write a card.
  3. If it is a small thing we write a butterfly card, this then needs to go to Edwin and Dion, in order to get on the butterfly board.
  4. If it is a big thing, then we write a card, this needs to go to aplanning game etc.
  5. You may work on bug cards while on support but you don't have to.
  6. We log all written cards [here](http://wiki/Dev/SupportNotes), returning a second day with the same issue will not get it done quicker.
