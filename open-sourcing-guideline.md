# Things to consider when open sourcing

  - Security
    - Make sure no passwords or confidential data (eg. csv files) are committed to the repo
      - If any confidential data is committed in the repo follow the steps from [here](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/) to remove it.
    - Make sure the code does not expose any security vulnerabilities. If it's a Rails project please refer to this [guideline](http://www.veracode.com/security/ruby-security/) and make sure [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) does not highlight any problems. If it'a a non Rails project see [this](http://www.toptal.com/security/10-most-common-web-security-vulnerabilities).
  
  - Documentation
    - The project should contain a Readme file (see below more info about the readme file)
    - Add inline comments where necessary. Comments should explain why you're doing something, not what you're doing.
      - Follow guideline from http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/source-code-comment-styling-tips/
      - Use words like (TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE, HACK, REVIEW) like [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#comments) to flag sections of code that need more work

  - Other notes
    - Make sure it does not depend on any private gem as now-one will be able to build it. If it depends on private repositories consider making the other repositories public

## The Readme file should answer the following questions:

  - What problem does the repository solve? You can also include a bit about how it solves the problem.
  - What do I need to do to install it?
  - How do I run the tests?
  - How do I use it?
    - You can also include:   
      - Usage examples
      - Troubleshooting
  - How do I contribute?
  - I still have more questions - where is the extra documentation?

You can also include badges for [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/), [TestCoverage](http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/219-setting-up-test-coverage) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) (if it's a Ruby repository).

Note: You can use the default template generated by `bundle gem my_gem` as a starting point for the Readme file.

Good Readme file examples:

 - https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv 
 
### Further steps
  - If it is a ruby gem publish it to https://rubygems.org/
  - Make it popular
    - Tell others about it via [our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/DevAtReevoo).
    - Write a blog post about it on our [engineering blog](http://reevoo.github.io/blog/).
    - Do a talk at local interest groups like [LRUG](http://lrug.org/).
    - Use it in our other public work!
