# Deployments

## Workflow:

- Developer ensures that tests have passed on the deployment candidate.
- Developer ensures that everything is signed off on staging.
- Developer kindly asks a dev ops to deploy.
- Dev ops ensures the developer in question is available for the next 10-15 mins to ensure the deployment goes smoothly.
- Dev ops deploy.
- Developer spens the next 15 minutes browsing round our clients, and monitoring the graphs to make sure it was clean.
- CANDY CORN!
