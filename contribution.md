# Contribution Checklist

This checklist should be followed whenever you are considering writing documentation. The checklist is to ensure you have thought carefully about writing documentation, and that documentation is the correct way of getting your point across.

## Before You Start

You should not go into a new contribution lightly. Documentation gets stale very quickly, takes a long time to write and is often rarely read. [It ain't Agile.](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) **Can you get your point across another way?** [Automated tools](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoocop) are better at enforcing rules, for example.

- [ ] Documentation is the only way.

You should ask yourself, **"who will read this, when, and why?"** before writing. This will make sure you can write the documentation at the right level and focus your efforts, rather than dump large amounts of disconnected information. Write it in the first paragraph if you want to force yourself to think about it.

- [ ] I know who I am writing for, when they will need this document, and why.

**Where are you going to put the documentation?** By keeping it close to the thing you are documenting, you are increasing its chances of being read. Putting it in a public place (such as a wiki) also increases its chances of being read. However, it is more important to link to it than to put it in the right place - see later!

- [ ] The documentation will be put in the right place.

## When You Are Writing

**Always explain.** It's the most important thing you can do in documentation, because often a reader will read a statement or rule and ask, "why?". If you don't explain, the reader is likely to dismiss your point as an opinion.

- [ ] I have explained the statements made in the documentation.

Imagine yourself coming to this document 6 months down the line. Is it small enough to throw out and re-write? **Is this document easy to maintain?** Can you edit diagrams? If the output is a PDF, is the original available to edit and re-export?

- [ ] The documentation is easy to maintain.

## After You Finish

Now you're done being an author, **pretend to be the reviewer.** When you self-review, you catch the errors likely to be picked up by your actual reviewer.

- [ ] I have proof-read the documentation.

Once your documentation is out in the world, **you need existing documentation to link to it so it can be seen.** There are many [orphaned pages](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-terminology-orphan-and-dead-end-pages/7373/) on the Internet, and they don't get much attention; if your documentation has no links to it, it won't get read.

- [ ] I have linked the document permanently to other documentation.
