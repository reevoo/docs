# Welcome to Reevoo Engineering!

Welcome to Reevoo! Hopefully you're getting settled in nicely. This article hopes to give you a few pointers that will get you up and running in the Reevoo Engineering team.

Note that this article is Engineering-specific; HR will greet you on the first day and take you through the things you have to do as a new employee. This guide will tell you the specifics of *your* Engineering role.

## Why Am I Here?

Quite an existential question for your first day in your new job. We hired you because you're awesome (we don't hire anyone else) and felt you could contribute to our team.

Your days here will consist primarily of coding, unsurprisingly. Most of our work is developing new products or features for existing products. We also spend time maintaining our existing products.

We like to organise ourselves in an Agile way. [We've written down our development process here.](https://reevoo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PLAT/How+the+Sprint+Works)

We don't expect you to be ready to code on Day 1. Really, we don't expect you understand anything we do on Day 1 - that's daunting at first, but please stick with it! There are a lot of words that we use on a day-to-day basis, but mean nothing to anyone else; you'll get used to these eventually, but don't worry about being confused to start with!

There are a couple of ways of getting 'ramped up' (ready to code) quickly:

- **Don't be embarrassed about not knowing stuff.** We'll show you in the first few weeks that we're constantly asking questions. It's the most direct way of figuring out what we do.
- **Ask to pair with people.** Pairing is a great experience that teaches you a lot about the code that you'll be working on in the future. You'll feel that you're slowing the other person down, *but that's okay* - we'd much rather you ask the questions now and get up to speed quickly than to leave you twiddling your thumbs, not knowing what to do, in months' time.
- **Socialise.** You're happier to work with a friend than a stranger, so it's important to get friendly with your colleages. The team provides a lot of opportunities to socialise and are a very relaxed group, so make sure you dive in!

In the first few weeks we will organise a set of meetings with team members to get up to speed with our current products. Don't worry about remembering everything - if you come out of these meetings with an idea of what the product does and where to go for more information, we've done our jobs properly!

## What Do I Do Now?

[**Follow this guide.**](https://reevoo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PLAT/New+Developer+Setup) It tells you everything you need to know about getting your system set up and running, and gives you a whistlestop tour of our products. Make sure to ask for help if you get stuck.

**Get [pairing](https://reevoo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PLAT/Pairing) with people!** If everybody's in a pair, join one of them and make it a trio. Nobody should mind you watching them code. They will be happy to explain what they're doing. In true Agile style, a lot of information is not in documentation, so you'll have to talk to people in order to get up to speed.

**Read code.** Once you've got access to Github, go and read the code for some of our products. It may be difficult to understand at first, so get someone to help you if you need it.
